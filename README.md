Create a Python Script that will count a CSV file of votes and declare a winner

● You will be given a file called votes.csv. Each row of this CSV will be a voter’s choice for a national candidate, and a one local candidate.

● Using only the Python Standard Library, create a Python script that will read this document, and declare a national winner and the local winners per region

● Create a Python function that will return the results of the election as a JSON string, then write that string to a log file.

Extra Challenge:

● Record the national winner per state

● The votes also contain a reserve national choice.

○ Run the vote count again, and If a voter’s national choice came in last, add their vote to their reserve candidate instead
